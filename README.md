## Features
- ### Flashcards
  - Tapping either Hiragana or Katakana on the main screen will bring you to the flash card page with the respective character set loaded in.
  - Tap the flash card to see the pronunciation in romaji.
  - If you got it right, tap Correct. Otherwise, tap Incorrect.
  - It's not just the honor system, it's to take the lessons into your own hands.
  - If you aren't too sure on the pronunciation, just hit the Listen button to hear it outloud.
- ### Quick Start
  - Tapping Quick Start on the main screen will, by default, drop you into a flash card session with both Hiragana and Katakana enabled.
  - On the main screen, tapping settings will take you to the settings screen where you can customize the Quick Start feature to suit your needs.
  - You can choose to assign Hiragana, Katakana, or both to the Quick Start feature.
  - If you want to try something different, you can tap Load to load in your own custom character sets (format will be described below)
  - You also have the option of enabling either Trace Mode or Voice Mode over the default flash card mode.
    - *Note that Trace and Voice modes are only available with Hiragana and Katakana*
  - Once you've customized Quick Start to your liking, tap Save so that your preferences will be remembered next time you launch the app.
- ### Character Drawing
  - If you enabled Trace Mode for Quick Start on the Settings screen, you'll be dropped into the character drawing section.
  - Here, try to practice drawing the characters by tracing over the guide.
  - If you make a mistake, just hit Clear to erase what you've drawn.
  - When you think you've got it, tap Submit to have it graded. If you did well enough, you'll go on to the next one.
     - *If you feel that there are issues with the grading tolerance, please let me know*
  - If you want a little extra challenge, tap Hide to take away the guide. Just tap Show to bring it back.
- ### Check Your Pronunciation
  - If you enabled Voice Mode for Quick Start on the Settings screen, you'll be dropped into the word pronunciation section.
  - You'll be given a series of words written in Hiragana or Katakana.
  - Just like with regular flash cards, you can tap them to see the pronunciation on the back.
  - Unlike normal flash cards, instead of a listen button, there's a microphone icon.
  - Tap it and attempt to pronounce the word.
  - If you got it right, you'll be taken to the next one.
  - If you had some trouble, you can repeat it as much as you'd like.
     - *If you feel that your pronunciation should have been accepted, please let me know*
- ### Load in your own character sets
  - On the Settings screen, if you tap Load, you'll be able to load in your own custom character sets!
  - Just create a text file with the characters and their pronunciations on alternating lines like so:     
`あ`     
`a`     
`い`     
`i`     
`う`     
`u`     
  - Be sure there are no spaces!
  - The limitations are a max of three characters on the Character lines and ten letters on the pronunciation lines.
  - Finally, save the file with the name of the character set and a .kk extension like so:
`hiragana.kk`
  - After it's loaded in, just tap Use Custom on the Settings screen and select your file.
  - Be sure to hit Save!
- ### Character browser
  - Tap the Browser button on the main screen to enter the character browser.
  - You'll be brought to a page where you can view every character in the set(s) currently assigned to Quick Start.
  - Tap a character of your choice to be brought into an inspection screen where you can view the pronunciation. You can even have it pronounced out loud with the Listen button so long as it's from the default character set.
- ### Push notifications
  - Just so you don't forget to keep up on your studies, if the app hasn't been opened in a day or so, a push notification reminder will be sent to the device.
